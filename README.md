### 2. Accessing a Network (SMB) Share

1.  On the main screen, switch to the **Network** tab.
2.  Enter the server address and folder path (e.g., `192.168.1.100\Photos` or `MYSERVER\Photos`).
    -   The app automatically detects your current subnet and suggests the appropriate IP template.
    -   You can use either IP addresses or server names (DNS resolution with NetBIOS fallback).
3.  Provide a username and password, or leave them blank for guest access.
4.  Optionally, enter a name for the connection and tap the **Save** icon (üíæ).
5.  **Auto-discovery**: Tap the **üîç** button to automatically scan and add all accessible shares from the server.
6.  Tap **Test** to verify the connection before saving.
7.  Tap **Slideshow** or **Sort** to begin.

## Usage Guide

### Slideshow Controls

The slideshow offers two control modes, which can be toggled in **Settings**.

**Mode 1: Invisible Touch Zones (Default)**

The screen is divided into invisible zones for a distraction-free experience.

**Mode 2: Visible Button Panel**

Enable this mode in **Settings ‚Üí Slideshow Settings ‚Üí Show Controls**. A minimalist panel with buttons for Back, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, and Rotate will appear.

### Sorting Screen

-   **Navigate**: Swipe left or right to browse through media.
-   **Copy/Move/Delete/Rename**: Use the buttons at the bottom to manage files. These operations can be enabled or disabled in **Settings**.
-   **Refresh**: Tap the refresh button at the top to re-read the folder contents.
-   **Destinations**: Configure up to 10 sort destinations in the **Settings ‚Üí Sort to..** tab.

## Settings

### Sort to.. Settings

-   **Allow to Copy**: Enable copying files to destination folders.
-   **Allow to Move**: Enable moving files to destination folders.
-   **Allow to Delete**: Enable deleting files with optional confirmation.
-   **Allow renaming**: Enable renaming files (validates filename and prevents conflicts).

### Slideshow Settings

-   **Show Controls**: Toggle between invisible touch zones and visible button panel.

### Video Settings

-   **Enable Video**: Allow video playback in slideshows.
-   **Max Video Size**: Set maximum file size for videos (in MB).

-   **Show detailed video error information**: Display comprehensive error diagnostics when video playback fails.
-   **Supported Formats**: MP4, MKV, MOV, WEBM, 3GP (AVI format not supported for SMB streaming due to library compatibility issues). Images: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WEBP.

### General Settings

-   **Not allow device to sleep**: Keep screen on during slideshow and sorting (enabled by default).

## Build from Source

To build the application from the source code, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have Android SDK with API 35 installed.
3.  To sign a release build, create a `keystore.properties` file in the root directory with your signing key details.
4.  Run the appropriate Gradle task:

    -   **Debug APK**:
        ```bash
        ./gradlew assembleDebug
        ```
    -   **Release App Bundle (for Google Play)**:
        ```bash
        ./gradlew bundleRelease
        ```

## Troubleshooting

### Slideshow Issues

If videos or GIFs are not displaying in slideshow mode:

1. **Check Logs**: The app includes detailed logging for media loading diagnostics. Check the device logs using Android Studio's Logcat with filter `tag:SlideshowActivity`.
2. **Video Playback**: Ensure videos are in supported formats (MP4, MKV, MOV, WEBM, 3GP). AVI is not supported for SMB streaming.
3. **GIF Support**: Animated GIFs are supported as image files and should display with animation.
4. **File Size**: Check that video files don't exceed the maximum size limit set in Video Settings.
5. **Network Issues**: For SMB shares, ensure stable network connection and proper permissions.
6. **Crash Logs**: If the app crashes, detailed error information is saved to the app's external files directory and displayed in crash dialogs.

### SMB Connection Issues

- **Write Permissions**: The app automatically detects write permissions for SMB folders. If sort buttons are missing, the folder may be read-only. Note: SMB folders default to write-enabled for better compatibility.
- **Connection Testing**: Use the Test button when adding SMB connections to verify access.
- **Auto-discovery**: Use the üîç button to automatically find available shares on a server.

### Performance Issues

- **Media Validation**: The app performs fast header validation (<100ms) to skip corrupted files.
- **Preloading**: Images and videos are preloaded for smooth transitions.
- **Memory**: Large video files may cause performance issues - adjust the max video size setting.

### Getting Help

- **Crash Reports**: Crash dialogs include full stack traces and device information.
- **Logs**: Enable detailed logging in development builds for troubleshooting.
- **Error Codes**: Video playback errors include ExoPlayer error codes for precise diagnosis.

-   **Language**: 100% Kotlin
-   **Architecture**: MVVM with a Repository pattern, using LiveData and Kotlin Coroutines.
-   **UI**: Material Design 3, ViewPager2, RecyclerView, and ConstraintLayout.
-   **Database**: Room for storing SMB connection profiles.
-   **Networking**: jCIFS-ng for SMBv2/SMBv3 client support.
-   **Media**: ExoPlayer for video playback with custom SMB data source.
-   **Image Loading**: Glide for efficient image loading and caching.
-   **Validation**: Fast media header validation (<100ms) to detect corrupted files before loading.
-   **Error Handling**: Global crash handler with detailed error dialogs and logging for troubleshooting.
-   **Minimum SDK**: API 28 (Android 9.0)
